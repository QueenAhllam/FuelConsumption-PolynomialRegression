# FuelConsumption-PolynomialRegression
# FuelConsumption - Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates a simple Polynomial Regression analysis using the `FuelConsumption.csv` dataset. The regression model predicts the target variable based on a selected feature, leveraging a 5th-degree polynomial.

## Features
- Preprocessing the data:
  - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Applying Polynomial Transformation (degree = 5).
- Training a Linear Regression model on the transformed data.
- Plotting:
  - Training and testing data points.
  - The polynomial regression curve.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/QueenAhllam/FuelConsumption-PolynomialRegression.git
   cd FuelConsumption-PolynomialRegression
